/* This function will first select a random numbetween 0 and 999 and start a loop,

 and will start the loop again.

 If the user gets it smaller, the program will inquire the user of that as well and will
 start over the loop.

 If the user guessed it successfully, it will inquire a congradulations message and will 
 break the loop.
